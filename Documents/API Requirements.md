## Data Migration

The provided script migrates categories and products from a REST API to Sanity CMS. Below is an overview of its functionality:

### Features

1. Fetches categories and products from a REST API.
2. Uploads images to Sanity CMS.
3. Maps categories and links them to products.
4. Saves data to Sanity CMS with structured schemas.

### Example Usage

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv @sanity/client
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node migrateData.js
   ```

### Key Code Snippet

```javascript
const targetClient = createClient({
  projectId: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
  dataset: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET || "production",
  useCdn: false,
  apiVersion: "2023-01-01",
  token: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN,
});

// Migrate categories and products
async function migrateData() {
  console.log("Starting data migration...");
  // Fetch and migrate data
}
```

## API Implementation Steps

To ensure a smooth API setup and integration, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Sanity CMS**:
   - Create a new Sanity project.
   - Configure schemas for products, categories, and orders.
   - Connect the Sanity project to your frontend using the Sanity client.

2. **Setup Third-Party APIs**:
   - Register and set up credentials for Stripe and Shippo.
   - Use respective SDKs to handle payment processing and shipment tracking.

3. **Develop Backend API Endpoints**:
   - Build RESTful endpoints for:
     - Product retrieval (`/api/products`)
     - Category retrieval (`/api/categories`)
     - Order creation and management (`/api/orders`)
   - Ensure endpoints handle authentication, validation, and error responses.

4. **Integrate Frontend and Backend**:
   - Connect the frontend to the backend API endpoints.
   - Use hooks and state management for dynamic updates.

5. **Test API Functionality**:
   - Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test endpoints.
   - Write integration tests to ensure all APIs work as expected.

6. **Optimize and Monitor**:
   - Enable logging for API requests and responses.
   - Use monitoring tools to track API performance.
